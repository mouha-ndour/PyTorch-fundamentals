If we carry out computations in PyTorch, it will build such a graph internally by default if one of its terminal nodes has the requires_grad attribute set to True. This is useful if we want to compute gradients. Gradients are required when training neural networks via the popular backpropagation algorithm, which can be thought of as an implementation of the chain rule from calculus for neural networks\n",
        "\n",
        "- retain_graph :=By default, PyTorch destroys the computation graph after calculating the gradients to free memory. However, since we are going to reuse this computation graph shortly, we set retain_graph=True so that it stays in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- .backward :=\n",
        "- .grad := We can call .backward on the loss, and PyTorch will compute the gradients of all the leaf nodes in the graph, which will be stored via the tensors’ .grad attributes:"
